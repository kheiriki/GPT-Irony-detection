# GPT-Irony-detection
This project focuses on developing an irony detection system using GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-3.5 embeddings, and machine learning techniques. The objective is to identify instances of irony in text using state-of-the-art language models and enhance the system's performance with machine learning on the 2019 SemEval dataset.
# Project Overview
Irony detection in text is a crucial natural language processing (NLP) task with numerous applications, including sentiment analysis, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis. This project employs advanced language models, GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 embeddings, to understand and recognize irony within textual data.
# Data
## 2019 SemEval Dataset:
The dataset from the SemEval-2016 shared task on detecting irony in tweets provides the primary data for this project.
# Implementation Steps
## 1. Data Preprocessing:
The SemEval dataset is preprocessed, involving essential steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction.
## 2. GPT-3.5 Turbo Integration:
GPT-3.5 Turbo, a powerful language model, is integrated to generate contextual embeddings for the text data, capturing rich semantic representations.
## 3. GPT-3.5 Embedding:
GPT-3.5 embeddings are used to extract high-level features from the text, enhancing the model's understanding of linguistic nuances.
## 4. Machine Learning Model:
A machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) is trained using the enriched features obtained from GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 embeddings.
## 5. Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) on a validation dataset.
## 6. Irony Detection:
The trained model is applied to detect irony in unseen text samples, providing a binary classification of ironic and non-ironic statements.

# Results and Evaluation
Detailed evaluation results, including model performance metrics, will be documented and shared in the project repository.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the integration of advanced language models like GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-3.5 embeddings, combined with machine learning, to effectively detect irony in textual data. The ultimate goal is to enhance understanding and analysis of linguistic subtleties and sentiments in text, with potential applications in various domains.
